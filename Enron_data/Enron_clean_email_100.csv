0,Here is our forecast
1,"Traveling to have a business meeting takes the fun out of the trip.  Especially if you have to prepare a presentation.  I would suggest holding the business plan meetings here then take a trip without any formal business meetings.  I would even try and get some honest opinions on whether a trip is even desired or necessary.As far as the business meetings, I think it would be more productive to try and stimulate discussions across the different groups about what is working and what is not.  Too often the presenter speaks and the others are quiet just waiting for their turn.   The meetings might be better if held in a round table discussion format.  My suggestion for where to go is Austin.  Play golf and rent a ski boat and jet ski's.  Flying somewhere takes too much time."

I have estimated the lotimprovement costs based on a 28 lot development we investigated in Northwidening.  Even though this property is not likely to require streetwidening and will have less of a detention/retention and filtration pondrequirement, I used this data to be cautious.expected to impact sales significantly.  Other projects have been quiteis uneven.  We have included a fence around the entire property, but mayonly put it on Westgate and Cameron Loop.  Gated communities are farpreferred so this is a good idea for both screening and current buyeran extended escrow.  This will enable us to probably obtain an approved siteplan before closing on the contract, which will mean that we can close intoprofits of the project.  As we discussed in San Marcos, we can also discusshaving you invest only in the lots, sell the lots to the construction entitywith your profit in the lot.  I believe this would facilitate the use of abe the equity for that project.  You would need to discuss this with anAntonio if you do not know anyone.I will send you a package on the property that was prepared by the broker,Once you have read the package and reviewed this proforma, we would want toschedule a tour of the site and the area.
